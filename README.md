# SVD-IC
Singular Value Decomposition based Image Compression

## Intro
A project that implements a form of image compression using singular value
decomposition of the image as a matrix. This project uses MATLAB.

## Project Setup
If you don't already have MATLAB installed, install it now.

If you haven't already, clone this repository or download and extract it as an
archive.

Open the script `main.m` with MATLAB.

## Understanding the code
Use the comments (i.e. lines starting with a `%`) to understand what the
code is doing.
